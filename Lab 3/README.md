# Assignment Three

## 1. Implement Mergesort

## 2. Implement Binary Search
Suppose we have a sorted sequence of objects *A* and would like to check if a value *v* is in *A*, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against *v* and eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. The Binary Search Algorithm repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remainding portion of the sequence each time.

## 3. **O(Logn)** Power Function
Use the *Divide and Conquer* design to generate an algorithm to compute *a^n*, where *a* and *n* are two positive integers input by the user.
